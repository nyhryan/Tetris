# Tetris-SDL2

![Tetris image](https://i.imgur.com/8w5VpdC.png)

Simple tetris project with SDL2 & C++.
I followed this video tutorial. [ðŸŽž [Creating Tetris in C++ with raylib - Beginner Tutorial (OOP)]](https://youtu.be/wVYKG_ch4yM)

- Implemented basic features like hard drop, shadow blocks, wall kicks (but I am not sure if wall kick is properly working.)
- Difficulty increases by increasing tetromino's falling speed every 2 line clears.
- Scoring system follows [Original BPS scoring system](https://tetris.wiki/Scoring#Recent_guideline_compatible_games).

## Build
Need to configure `SDL2`, `SDL2 image`, `SDL2 ttf` directory in the VS project.
After building the project with VS, `/Assets` and SDL `.dll` files needs to be in a same directory where `.exe` file sits.

## Keys
- <kbd>Left Arrow</kbd>, <kbd>Right Arrow</kbd> : Move tetromino left, right
- <kbd>Up Arrow</kbd> : Hard drop
- Hold <kbd>Down Arrow</kbd> : Drop faster (but you can also drop it faster while tapping repetitively, which is unintended)
- (Release) <kbd>Z</kbd> : Rotate counterclockwise
- (Release) <kbd>X</kbd> : Rotate clockwise
- <kbd>Enter</kbd> : Start game

## TODO
- Proper Combo system & scoring system
- Sometimes I-Block will clip out from the playing grid and makes game crash?
- Original tetris game has a feature that after tetromino has placed on its position, you can move the tetromino for a while. Need this feature.
- MUSIC ðŸŽ¶
- Main menu, pause menu, etc.
- Bugs that I might not have noticed
- It is quite difficult to calculate anything related to frames and timings, which can be used on combo system, free to move around after placing the tetromino for a while, I need further understanding.
- Tetrominos will rotate on the RELEASE of `z, x` key, which was done to mitigate blocks rotating in a blazing speed while holding `z, x` keys. Rotating block on the release of the key feels bit weird.
